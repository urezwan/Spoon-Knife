1. First, have to initialize the repo before adding remote using HTTPS.
2. Git push origin main will not work if Remote branch is main but local branch is Master.
   Resolution is to rename the local branch as Main by "git branch -m main"

3. How about pushing into another remote branch that not created yet? In that case, local branch name must match remote branch name and if not present, needs to be created.
